          <h2>Facts About Steph Curry</h2>
          <p>
            Stephen Curry, often regarded as one of the greatest basketball
            players of all time, revolutionized the game with his incredible
            shooting ability. Born on March 14, 1988, in Akron, Ohio, Curry
            plays for the Golden State Warriors in the NBA. He is a two-time NBA
            MVP, winning the award in 2015 and 2016, and led the Warriors to
            four NBA championships (2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022). Curry is widely
            recognized for his record-breaking three-point shooting, setting
            numerous records for the most three-pointers made in a season and in
            NBA history. Off the court, he’s also known for his philanthropy,
            particularly his work in education and efforts to combat hunger.
            Despite being overlooked by many top colleges due to his size and
            background, Curry's determination and skill led him to a stellar NBA
            career, earning him the nickname “The Chef” for his ability to
            “cook” defenses with his shooting precision.

            In addition to his shooting prowess, Stephen Curry is known for his
            leadership and basketball IQ. He holds the record for the most
            three-pointers made in NBA playoff history and is the all-time
            leader for the Golden State Warriors in points and assists. Curry
            was instrumental in popularizing the "small-ball" lineup,
            transforming the way the game is played with his ability to stretch
            the floor and space the court. His influence has reshaped how future
            generations approach shooting, and he continues to inspire young
            players to focus on skill development rather than size.
